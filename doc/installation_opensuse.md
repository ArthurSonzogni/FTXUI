## openSUSE Package (Unofficial)

FTXUI seems to be available from the `devel:libraries:c_c++` repository.

```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:libraries:c_c++/openSUSE_Leap_$releasever/devel:libraries:c_c++.repo
sudo zypper install ftxui
```

See <https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:libraries:c_c++/ftxui> for details.

> [!note]
> This is an **unofficial** package. That means it is not maintained by the FTXUI
> team, but by the community.
